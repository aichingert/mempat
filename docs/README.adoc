=  μοτίβα (pattern)

This is a simple websocket written in go to play a pattern memorization game with friends.

== Missing

Currently the game has to be implemented on the server and then the following options are also missing:

* Restart on lose or win
* Showing the pattern on the start of a new round or new connection maybe (but this could be abused)
* Proper message sending between client and server
